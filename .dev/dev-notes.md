Future Improvement Ideas
- more error handling in controllers, maybe use a ControllerAdvice
- Improve endpoint naming/structure. 
  - Maybe have only one '/reports' endpoint that returns any of them based on Post request parameters.
- Group common code from service classes 
- Import data at startup, maybe InitializingBean or ApplicationListener
- non-h2 db
- docker compose
