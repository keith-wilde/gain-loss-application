(Keep general plan/notes in here)

1. Create controller(s), service, dao classes (maybe initially without including db)
 - Just get basic Spring part running 

2. Get importing of excel into dto objects working.
(Probably use POI library?)
 - Import on application start or through endpoint? 
   - To start with, check if table empty before doing import on app startup

3. Include database, setup entities, repos, do real service impl - include basic unit tests? 

4. Implement individual repo methods based on requirements
 - maybe need native queries for some cases?

5. Extras if have time - 
endpoint that does import 
Use docker compose with spring and postgres containers.
